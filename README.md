# Transforming-Amino-Acid-Sequences-For-Quantum-Circuits
We're encoding the amino acid sequence into binary strings and building a quantum circuit for each one. Then, we're creating a list of Pauli operators for each circuit, one for each qubit, and multiplying them together to get a badass Hamiltonian.
