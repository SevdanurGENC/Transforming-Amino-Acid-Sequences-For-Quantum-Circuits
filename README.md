# Transforming-Amino-Acid-Sequences-For-Quantum-Circuits

We're encoding the amino acid sequence into binary strings and building a quantum circuit for each one. Then, we're creating a list of Pauli operators for each circuit, one for each qubit, and multiplying them together to get a badass Hamiltonian. And then, to top it off, we're printing the resulting quantum states for each circuit. We're using the Pauli and PauliOp classes from qiskit.quantum_info and qiskit.opflow, respectively, to create those operators and Hamiltonians. And, of course, we're using the Aer module from qiskit to simulate the circuits and calculate the quantum states.
